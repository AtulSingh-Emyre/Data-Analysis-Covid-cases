# Data-Analysis-Covid-cases
Data Analysis project on Covid
The project is a course project at Indian Institute of Technology, Dharwad which uses the various techniques of data analysis covered in the course.
It consists of mainly 3 sections and is built competely over jupyter notebook using Python 3:
<H3> Introduction </H3>
This section begins with a basic introductory paragraph to the virus and provides a basic idea of the current scenario faced by the world. The plots covered in here include :
<ul> <li> World cases data - daily count - line graph </li>
<li> World deaths data - daily count - line graph </li>
<li> World different countries data - heat map </li>
<li> India cases data - daily count - line graph </li>
<li> India deaths data - daily count - line graph </li>
</ul>
<H3> Hypothesis : </H3>
<ol> 
<li> <H5> Cases Across Different Countries :</H5>
<p> Statement : We expect the situation to be about the same in IND and USA in regard to the cases of covid </p>
<p> Math : H0,H1, calculations... </p>
<p> Graphical representation of the above :<br>
<ul> <li> IND and USA cases data - daily count - line graph, box plot </li> </ul>
Conclusion : -----
</p></li>
<li> <h5> Age Groups :</h5> (we cover 3 groups)
<p> Statement : We expect the older age group to be more adversely affected due to covid in terms of cases </p>
<p> Math : H0,H1, calculations... (using categorical data) </p>
<p> Graphical representation of the above :<br>
<ul> 
<li> cases across age groups - pie chart </li> 
<li> cases across age groups - scatter plot with monthly data </li>
</ul>
Conclusion : -----
</p></li>
<li> <h5> Effect on other Diseases :</h5> (we cover 2 diseases)
<p> Statement : We expect countries with higher number of cases to have higher number in obesity and other diseases. We shall use IND and <> for the same. </p>
<p> Math : H0,H1, calculations... (using categorical data) </p>
<p> Graphical representation of the above :<br>
<ul> 
<li> obesity cases in IND and few other countries - bar graph </li> 
<li> cases in corresponding countries - line graph (to be plotted in same graph as above) </li>
<li> Disease 2 cases in IND and few other countries - bar graph </li> 
<li> cases in corresponding countries - line graph (to be plotted in same graph as above) </li>
</ul>
Conclusion : -----
</p></li>


<li> <h5> Altitude :</h5>
<p> Statement : We expect to see more cases in areas with higher altitude </p>
<p> Math : H0,H1, calculations... (using categorical data) </p>
<p> Graphical representation of the above :<br>
<ul> 
<li> Altitude of different countries - bar graph </li> 
<li> cases in corresponding countries - line graph (to be plotted in same graph as above) </li>
</ul>
Conclusion : -----
</p></li>

<li> <h5> Economy :</h5> 
<p> Statement : <to be filled> </p>
<p> Math : H0,H1, calculations... (using categorical data) </p>
<p> Graphical representation of the above :<br>
<ul> 
</ul>
Conclusion : -----
</p></li>


<li> <h5> Lockdown effects in different countries :</h5>
<p> Statement : We expect to see less rise in cases in areas with prolonged lockdowns </p>
<p> Math : H0,H1, calculations... (using categorical data) </p>
<p> Graphical representation of the above :<br>
<ul>  
<li> per day rise in cases in 3 countries - line graph (to be plotted in same graph as above) with 2 verticle lines symbolizing lockdown period </li>
</ul>
Conclusion : -----
</p></li>
